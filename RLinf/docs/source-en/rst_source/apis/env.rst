Environment Interface
======================

This section provides the key APIs of the **environment** in the RLinf framework,  
specifically designed for **embodied intelligence** scenarios.  
As an example, we demonstrate the env setup using LIBERO as the background.  
For any other simulator, the process is analogous.
