Actor Interface
=================

This section provides the key APIs of the **Actor** classes in the RLinf framework.  
It includes implementations based on both **Megatron** and **FSDP** backends.  
In addition, information about the `ModelManager` is provided. As the parent class of the Actor classes, it manages the underlying model as well as critical APIs for parameter onload/offload.
