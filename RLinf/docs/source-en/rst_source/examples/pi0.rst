Reinforcement Learning on π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  Models
==================================================================

This example provides a complete guide to fine-tuning the 
π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  algorithms with reinforcement learning in the **LIBERO** environment
using the **RLinf** framework. It covers the entire process—from
environment setup and core algorithm design to training configuration,
evaluation, and visualization—along with reproducible commands and
configuration snippets.

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing
robotic manipulation by:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot’s
   camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task
   descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position,
   rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via the PPO with
   environment feedback.

--------------

Environment
-----------

**LIBERO Environment**

-  **Environment**: LIBERO simulation benchmark built on top of
   *robosuite* (MuJoCo).
-  **Task**: Command a 7-DoF robotic arm to perform a variety of
   household manipulation skills (pick-and-place, stacking, opening
   drawers, spatial rearrangement).
-  **Observation**: RGB images (typical resolutions 128 × 128 or 224 ×
   224) captured by off-screen cameras placed around the workspace.
-  **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions - 3D end-effector
   position control (x, y, z) - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw) -
   Gripper control (open / close)

**Task Description Format**

   π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  directly use the environment-provided natural-language
   task description as the language model input.

**Data Structure**

-  **Images**: Main-view and wrist-view RGB tensors, each of shape
   ``[batch_size, 3, 224, 224]``
-  **States**: End-effector position, orientation, and gripper state
-  **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
-  **Rewards**: Sparse success/failure rewards

--------------

Algorithm
---------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   -  Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)
   -  Policy clipping with ratio limits
   -  Value function clipping
   -  Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

   -  For every state / prompt the policy generates *G* independent
      actions
   -  Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group’s
      mean reward.

Running Scripts
---------------

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

Here you can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and
actor components. Using the above configuration, you can achieve
pipeline overlap between env and rollout, and sharing with actor.
Additionally, by setting ``pipeline_stage_num = 2`` in the
configuration, you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and
actor, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete sharing,
where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete separation,
where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs without
interference, eliminating the need for offload functionality.

--------------

**2. Model Key Parameter Configuration**

**2.1 Model Parameters**

.. code:: yaml

   openpi:
     noise_level: 0.5
     action_chunk: ${actor.model.num_action_chunks}
     num_steps: ${actor.model.num_steps}
     train_expert_only: True
     action_env_dim: ${actor.model.action_dim}
     noise_method: "flow_sde"
     add_value_head: False
     pi05: False 
     value_after_vlm: False

| You can adjust ``noise_level`` and ``num_steps`` to control
  the noise intensity and flow-matching steps.
| Different noise injection methods can be chosen via ``noise_method``.
  We provide two options:
  `flow_sde <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470>`__ and
  `flow_noise <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094>`__.

You can set ``pi05: True`` to enable π\ :sub:`0.5`\  mode, and set ``value_after_vlm`` to control the input path of state features: True to input to VLM part (π\ :sub:`0.5`\  default configuration), False to input to action expert (π\ :sub:`0`\  default configuration).

**2.2 LoRA Settings**

.. code:: yaml

   model:
     is_lora: True
